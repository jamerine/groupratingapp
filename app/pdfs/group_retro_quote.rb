Unlike the prospective Group Rating program, premium refunds are paid based on the performance of the group. Members receive a dependable and aggressive cost control strategy upon enrollment. All members will be required to meet the program safety requirements. <i>(i.e.: salary continuation and/or transitional work for a minimum of 8 weeks, IME requirements, aggressive settlements, handicap reimbursement and subrogation)</i> These safety requirements along with #{@account.representative.company_name.upcase}â€™s superior claims management are why our program is the best for maximizing refunds and limiting any risks.", size: 8, inline_format: true
